    "# NQueens Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to generate one right sequence through Genetic Programming. The sequence has to be 8 numbers between 0 to 7. Each number represents the positions the Queens can be placed. Each number refers to the row number in the specific column\n",
    "\n",
    "0 3 4 5 6 1 2 4\n",
    "\n",
    "· 0 is the row number in the column 0 where the Queen can be placed\n",
    "\n",
    "· 3 is the row number in the column 1 where the Queen can be placed"

    "## Genetic Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be many different approaches to solve the NQueens problem but in this notebook we will be using Genetic Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "In a genetic algorithm, a population of candidate solutions to an optimization problem is evolved toward better solutions. Each candidate solution has a set of properties (its chromosomes or genotype) which can be mutated and altered; traditionally, solutions are represented in binary as strings of 0s and 1s, but other encodings are also possible.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolution usually starts from a population of randomly generated individuals, and is an iterative process, with the population in each iteration called a generation. In each generation, the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated; the fitness is usually the value of the objective function in the optimization problem being solved. The more fit individuals are stochastically selected from the current population, and each individual's genome is modified (recombined and possibly randomly mutated) to form a new generation. The new generation of candidate solutions is then used in the next iteration of the algorithm. Commonly, the algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations has been produced, or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population."
